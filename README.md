# iFlyDirect // Main Concept:

- Non-stop flight booking app
- Select from/to cities and dattes to find non-stop only flights
- Possible DB: users, flights, etc

## Required packages

------------- For Admin (Backend)
npm install
npm i express
npm i cors
npm i dotenv
npm i method-override
npm i bcrypt
npm i json-web-token

------------- For Client (FrontEnd)
npm i react-router-dom
npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i react-date-range  //calender library 
npm i date-fns  //date formatter to convert to strings
<!-- npm i -S http-proxy-middleware -->
npm i axios //Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase).

### Deliverables / MVP:

- A link to your app, which is deployed somewhere.
- A link to your GitHub repository (or repositories if there are multiple), so we can see the progress on your app.
- Select to/from cities with a date range for round-trip

### Bonus Features:

### General Requirements:

- This project cannot be part of a lab or assignment we've already done in class.
- This project is group by default (no more than 4 people per group), but can be done individually if approved by instructor.
- This project should feature user authentication (i.e., secure logins and passwords).
- Effort must be spent on styling, appearance, and user experience.
- This app must be tracked in GitHub, with a minimum of 25 commits.
- Ideally, put your empty project up on GitHub on day one of development, and aim for multiple commits per day.
- This app must be deployed somewhere.
- The app should have a README.md file including what is referenced below in the application requirements.

### Project Requirements:

This project is your choice. You will create an impressive application to add to your personal portfolio, but how you do that is up to you. It can be a group or individual project. Your project should center around your goals post-graduation and be a great addition to your personal portfolio website. What you do depends on what part of the industry you'd like to join, or what technologies you would like to work with. For example, front-end development, back-end development, fintech (financial technology), game development, and more.

### Application Requirements:

- Your back-end uses Python or Node.
- Your back-end uses Flask or Django (Python) or Express (Node).
- Your front-end may use React, or another front-end framework (e.g., Vue, Angular), or a template language (EJS, Pug, Handlebars).
- Your app must have a database that has at least two tables (SQL) or collections (Mongo).
- Your database must support at least one type of database relationship between tables/collections.
- - This can be embedded or relational data in Mongo (An embedded collection will qualify as your second collection).
- - This can be a 1:M (one-to-many) or N:M (many-to-many) relationship between SQL tables.
- Your app uses an ORM or ODM to interact with your database (e.g., Sequelize, PyMongo, SQLAlchemy, TypeORM, Mongoose).
- This app must run in a web browser.
- Your website should be responsive to screen size changes.
- - This means that your website should be viewable and usable on a mobile device or tablet via an internet browser. Text shouldn't be super tiny and layouts shouldn't exceed the - screen size on smaller screens.
- The app should have a README.md file including the following:
- - Describes the inspiration for the application.
- - Describes how to use the application.
- - Lists the technologies used to build the application.
- - Addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality.

#### Bonus Ideas

- Use SASS for styling.
- Create your project using TypeScript.
- Use CircleCI for continuous integration.
- Use at least one library, package, or technology that we haven't covered.
